These are the R scripts used to perform ancestral character state estimation on various phylogenies.

N.b. files did not originate in this dir and have been moved from their respective topology/rateCategory dir for clarity and filepaths have been updated in the scripts

starting p values are taken from the best rate estimation result using Step4 in the relevant topology/rateCategory (see README in "Step1_EstimateRates_and_SelectBestModel/")
